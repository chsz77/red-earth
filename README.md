# red-earth
website: https://redearth.herokuapp.com

This site was made with MongoDB, Express, React-Redux, and Node.js

The theme of this site is Earth and sad facts that we are destroying it.
This site purpose is to share images of most polluted places on Earth.
Authenticated Users can submit new image, do edit or delete it, then they can add comments or delete their own.
Users can also "Mark Red" the images to keep it on top of "REDEST" page and vote comments

I'm using images from dummyimage.com to seed database. Same as faker, it can be unreliable. 

Well, Sign Up and Enjoy!
